# Instructions

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. 

> `Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.` 

>   `When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".` 

>     `When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 

>       `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`

e.g. it might start off like this:

```
`1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz"""
